# Ethan Dang Escapes! #

This game was originally meant to be my end of the year project for computer science 3 in high school...
but since a friend of mine has his birthday coming up, I decided to turn that project into a video game all about him!
A lot of the content in this game as such are based on inside jokes between the two of us along with some other jokes I threw in fo funsies!
